6. Mr. Zamora Rivas (El Salvador) introduced draft resolution A/C.2/70/L.30 on behalf of the States members of the Central American Integration System and said that Ukraine wished to join the sponsors. Sustainable tourism was an engine of economic and social development since it contributed to employment, income and hard currency reserves and helped eradicate poverty. It should therefore be boosted through sustainable policies and practices that minimized the impact on the environment and on the cultural heritage of the region. Central America was vulnerable to climate change and immediate preventive, adaptation and response measures were needed. Resolutions adopted at the United Nations, and the work of the World Tourism Organization in particular, were important for defining policies on environmental protection, respect for culture and inclusive economic management as prerequisites for sustainable tourism.
