The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a. m.
Expression of sympathy in connection with the recent typhoon in the Philippines
1. The Chair, on behalf of all the members of the Committee, expressed sympathy and condolences to the Government and people of the Philippines for the enormous loss of life and the devastation caused by the recent typhoon.
2. At the invitation of the Chair, the members of the Committee observed a minute of silence.
3. Mr. Borje (Philippines) thanked the Chair for the expression of sympathy.
Agenda item 49: Effects of atomic radiation
(continued) (A/C.4/68/L.7/Rev.1 and L.8)
Draft resolution A/C.4/68/L.7/Rev.1: effects of atomic radiation
4. Ms. Carayanides (Australia), introducing the draft resolution, drew particular attention to paragraphs 1,
4. 5 and 7 endorsing the achievements and the programme of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation; paragraph 8 calling for timely publication of the Scientific Committee's reports by the Secretariat; paragraph 14 on the question of the Scientific Committee's funding; paragraph 12 regarding data collection; and paragraph 16 regarding expressions of interest in membership in the Scientific Committee.
5. The Chair, noting that the draft resolution had no programme budget implications, informed the Committee that, in view of the agreement reached on the text of paragraph 16 - thanks to the Australian delegation's skill, and political will on all sides - draft amendment A/C.4/68/L.8 had been withdrawn by its sponsor. Also, the sponsors of the draft resolution had been joined by Armenia, the Czech Republic, Ireland, the Netherlands, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Romania and Slovakia.
6. Draft resolution A/C.4/68/L. 7/Rev. 1 was adopted.
7. Mr. Sahraei (Islamic Republic of Iran), speaking in explanation of position, said that his delegation had been pleased to join the consensus on the draft resolution, the final text of which incorporated in paragraph 16 the concerns of his proposed amendment. The Scientific Committee should have the benefit of
the expertise of all countries in conducting its valuable work, and a good way would be to extend membership to those States expressing an interest in serving on it.
Agenda item 54: Comprehensive review of special political missions (continued) (A/C.4/68/L.11)
Draft resolution A/C.4/68/L.11: Comprehensive review of special political missions
8. Mr. Alday Gonzalez (Mexico), introducing the draft resolution also on behalf of the co-facilitator, Finland, said that the Secretary-General's next report on the overall policy matters outlined in paragraph 4 should elucidate how the Organization intended to use the special political missions as an indispensable tool in the maintenance of international peace and security, and also as a mechanism that promoted system-wide coherence. The Committee's adoption of the draft resolution by consensus would reflect the international community's support for the missions and their personnel, who often operated under difficult circumstances.
9. The Chair informed the Committee that the draft resolution had no programme budget implications, and that the sponsors had been joined by Austria, Costa Rica, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Estonia, Fiji, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Portugal, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand and Uruguay.
10. Draft resolution A/C.4/68/L.11 was adopted.

(continued ) (A/C.4/68/L.12-L.15)

11. Mr. Khan (Indonesia), introducing the four draft resolutions under agenda item 51 (A/C.4/68/L.12-L.15) and reviewing their provisions, said that they reflected fundamental principles and positions regarding the rights of the Palestine refugees and the international community's commitment to alleviating their plight until a just solution was achieved, as well as its strong support for the humanitarian work of the United

Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which was making a vital contribution to regional stability. He expressed the hope that the draft resolutions would again receive the overwhelming support of the Committee.
12. Mr. Leon Gonzalez (Cuba), introducing the five draft resolutions under agenda item 52 (A/C.4/68/L.16L.20) and reviewing their provisions, said that the human rights situation of the civilian populations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the occupied Syrian Golan remained critical as a result of Israel's violations of human rights and international law. Conditions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, had deteriorated further as Israel continued its deliberate, systematic colonization, especially its illegal settlement campaign, which was jeopardizing the possibility of achieving a two-State solution based on pre-1967 borders. It was extremely important for the members of the Committee to stand firmly behind such crucial draft resolutions.

41. Mr. Sahraei (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that his delegation had voted in favour of draft resolutions A/C.4/68/L.16 to L.20 to show its solidarity with the Palestinian people and stress the importance of international recognition of their inalienable right to defend themselves from foreign occupation and aggression. Owing to lack of attention to the root causes of the Palestinian crisis, it had remained unresolved for more than six decades, while the illegal occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories by the Israeli regime had continued, as had the persistent violations of the rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination and the right of the Palestine refugees to return to their homeland. His delegation believed that lasting peace could be achieved only when discrimination and the occupation of all Palestinian land ended, all Palestine refugees returned to their homeland, democratic self-determination took place, and a democratic Palestinian State was established with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital.
42. Ms. Abdelhady-Nasser (Observer for the State of Palestine), making a general statement on the resolutions just adopted under items 51 and 52, said that they had reaffirmed the human rights of the Palestinian people, including the Palestine refugees, and the core principles of international law relevant to the question of Palestine. The search for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace remained elusive, but the Committee's actions exemplified the tangible difference that could be made through multilateral diplomacy.
43. Palestine was grateful for the commitment of Member States, host nations and the donor community to UNRWA and stressed the urgency of allocating more funds for the vital work the Agency was doing in the midst of a financial crisis.
44. The draft resolutions had reaffirmed that the rights of the Palestine refugees had not diminished with the passage of time, and that a just solution must be found to their plight on the basis of General Assembly resolution 194 (III). They had endorsed the Special Committee's efforts to raise international awareness about the gross, systematic human rights violations practised by Israel, and had reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention, the illegality of the Israeli settlement campaign and the other grave Israeli breaches that were sabotaging the small opportunity that remained for realizing the two-State solution and bringing peace. A clear message
had been sent to Israel that its violations must stop and that it must comply fully with all its obligations under international law.
45. Those who truly supported the cause of peace must remain consistent in demanding respect for the law and for human rights, essential to the achievement of a just, lasting solution of the question of Palestine, including the Palestine refugee problem. A just solution would guarantee the Palestinian people their inalienable rights, including the right to self-determination and to an independent State with East Jerusalem as its capital, and it would finally make peace, security and coexistence a reality for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.
46. Mr. Ja'afari (Syrian Arab Republic) said that the broad support for the draft resolutions just adopted under agenda items 52 and 53 sent an unambiguous message to Israel to end its occupation of all the occupied Arab territories and to stop violating human rights and humanitarian law, especially the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. In particular, the adoption by a majority of Member States of the resolution on the occupied Syrian Golan (A/C.4/68/L.20) confirmed that Israel's annexation of it and its subsequent issuance of absurd laws there, were without international legal effect. The measures it had taken and its dangerous, provocative stance recalled the darkest days of modern history when, at the beginning of the Second World War in Europe, a certain State had attacked and annexed parts of other countries.
47. The Israeli delegation had been the only one to vote against the draft resolution on the occupied Syrian Golan and had voted against all the other draft resolutions just adopted. He appealed to those few delegations that had abstained from voting on draft resolution A/C.4/68/L.20 to join the international consensus and vote in favour when it went before the plenary Assembly. Any failure to condemn the Israeli occupation and annexation by force would encourage continued conflict in the region and would send the wrong message to those who broke the law, suggesting that the law of the jungle had replaced the law, and that law-breakers could do as they pleased.
48. Mr. Sharoni (Israel) said that it took a great deal of audacity for the Syrian representative to criticize his country in such a manner, when he represented such a murderous regime responsible for killing more than 120,000 civilians in its own country.

49. Mr. Ja'afari (Syrian Arab Republic) said that the Israeli representative should refrain from talking politics, when as a beginner, he did not understand its principles or those of the Charter of the United Nations. He had not yet been born when Israel had annexed the Syrian Golan or when the Security Council had adopted resolution 497 (1981) condemning Israeli practices as the occupying Power, and he therefore could not understand their significance.
50. The decision taken by Israel to annex the Syrian Golan was reminiscent of the annexation decisions taken by Hitler on the eve of the Second World War. It was ironic that the Israelis who had always claimed that their settlement in Palestine and their occupation of it had been the result of the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis, should be the ones exercising against the Palestinians the same Nazi policies of annexation by force and disregard for the Geneva Conventions and international law. Israel had established criminal settlements that did not respect the right of people to live in their own land. Indeed, Israel's occupation of Arab territories was more egregious than any other occupation in the history of humanity.
51. Mr. Sharoni (Israel) said that although he might not have as many years of experience in diplomacy as the Syrian delegate, it did not take too many years to see where war crimes and crimes against humanity were being committed on a daily basis. The representative's cynical attack on Israel was another desperate attempt to divert attention from the real issue, and fooled no one. He represented a Government with absolutely no credibility, that cared nothing for the needs of its own people, the people of the Middle East, or anything else. Assad and his cronies sought only to maintain their own brutal regime in power while committing daily crimes against their own Syrian people.
52. Ms. Ventura (Canada) expressed sincere regret at the Syrian representative's comments suggesting some kind of connection between Israel and anything relating to the Nazis. Her delegation found such statements to be of serious concern.
53. Mr. Miller (United States of America) said that he too wished to express regret and concern about the comparison just drawn between Nazi Germany and Israel.
54. Mr. Selle (Germany) said that, while his delegation had voted in favour of the resolution on the
occupied Syrian Golan, it rejected unambiguously the outrageous comparison just made by the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic, which betrayed a stunning lack of historical insight.
55. Mr. Hamed (Syrian Arab Republic), advising the Israeli delegation not to make a laughing-stock of itself, urged his fellow delegates from Canada, the United States and Germany to call on Israel to respect United Nations resolutions, end its occupation of Arab territories, and stop violating human rights. If Israel did so, there would be no need to make comparisons between Israel and the Nazis or any other such comparisons, and no need for the Committee to adopt resolutions about its actions.
Agenda item 122: Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly (A/C.4/68/L.10)
Draft decision A/C.4/68/L.10: Proposed programme of work and timetable of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) for the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly
56. The Chair read out a minor drafting change.
57. Draft decision A/C.4/68/L.10, as orally revised, was adopted.
58. The Chair said that, pursuant to paragraph 13 of General Assembly resolution 67/297, inviting the chairs of the Main Committees to brief the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the Work of the General Assembly on working methods, he intended to prepare a conference room paper in consultation with the other members of the Bureau on the Committee's working methods and submit it to the members of the Committee prior to issuing it as his report to the Ad Hoc Working Group.
59. It was so decided.
Completion of the Committee's work
60. The Chair said that the work of the Fourth Committee was mainly political and that, as agreed by the members of the Committee, that character should be retained and strengthened. At the same time, the Committee also covered other important issues that related to many other aspects of the work of the Secretariat, such as public information, outer space and atomic radiation. The agenda items allocated to the Committee provided opportunities for delegations to consider those issues in depth and take advantage of

the flexible working methods it had adopted in recent years. The format of interactive dialogue, for instance, had proven to be very useful and informative.
61. He recalled that a few pending issues would have to be dealt with at a resumed session in 2014: the Report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations under agenda item 53; and the election of the Bureau for the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly. He declared that the Committee had completed its work for the main part of the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly.
The meeting rose at 12.20p.m.
