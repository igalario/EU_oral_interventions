The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
Expression of sympathy in connection with the recent attacks in Beirut and Paris
1. The Chair, on behalf of all the members of the Committee, expressed sympathy to the peoples and Governments of Lebanon and France in connection with the recent attacks in their respective capital cities.
Agenda item 54: United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East
(continued) (A/C.4/70/L.15, A/C.4/70/L.16,

2. Mr. Anshor (Indonesia), introducing the four draft resolutions submitted under agenda item 54 (A/C.4/70/L.15, A/C.4/70/L. 16, A/C.4/70/L.17 and A/C.4/70/L.18) and reviewing their provisions, said that they reflected fundamental principles and positions regarding the rights of Palestine refugees and the international community's commitment to alleviating their plight until a just solution was achieved, as well as its strong support for the humanitarian work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which was making a vital contribution towards regional stability and efforts to fulfil the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

4/9

A/C.4/70/SR.25
Golan had continued to worsen during the reporting period. Israel continued its policy of systematic aggression, provocation and collective punishment, which caused widespread suffering among the Palestinian population and further destabilized the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Israel was blatantly failing to comply with its legal obligations as an occupying Power in accordance with international law. Its illegal settlement campaign, which included land confiscation and appropriation of natural resources, was fragmenting the Palestinian territory and severely undermining the possibility of achieving a two-State solution. Such actions, compounded by the issue of impunity for settler violence, were to blame for the exponential rise in attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and constituted the main obstacle to peace. As described in the reports, Gaza was in the grip of a critical humanitarian situation, particularly as a result of the slow pace of reconstruction following the most recent Israeli military assault on the territory. He expressed the hope that Member States would stand firmly behind such crucial draft resolutions in view of the need for collective efforts to defend the principles of international law and reach a just, lasting and peaceful solution to the conflict.
17. Mr. de Jesus Martinez (Panama) expressed his Government's solidarity with and condolences to the Governments and peoples of France and Lebanon for the recent attacks perpetrated in their respective countries. Panama vigorously condemned all acts of violence and called on all civilized countries to work together to bring an end to such barbarity and ensure strict compliance with international law, which formed the bedrock of peace and security.
18. Speaking in explanation of vote before the voting, he said that his Government's position on the issues addressed in draft resolutions A/C.4/70/L.21 and A/C.4/70/L.22 had evolved over the last few years, passing through all three potential voting options. His country based its foreign policy on working for the common good through dialogue and consensus; its evolving position reflected its endeavours to strike a delicate balance between the different views, with full respect for human rights and support for the legitimate aspiration of Israel to live in peace within secure borders. Many resolutions under discussion at the current session of the General Assembly referred, either directly or indirectly, to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and expressed criticism of Israel. His Government shared the
near-universal view that Israel would enjoy lasting peace with Palestine and its other neighbours only if a two State solution was achieved, if mistrust and violence were replaced with dialogue and negotiation and if the legitimate aspirations of all peoples, including that of the Palestinian people to self-determination, were recognized. Panama therefore called on Israel and Palestine to reach an agreement that would result in coexistence between the Jewish State of Israel and the State of Palestine, including concrete measures to facilitate resolution of the conflict. Lasting peace could be achieved only through a political process.
19. The Chair said that the draft resolutions under agenda item 55 had no programme budget implications.

34. Draft resolution A/C.4/70/L.23 was adopted by 156 votes to 1, with 14 abstentions.
35. Mr. Maes (Luxembourg), speaking on behalf of the European Union, said that while the European Union member States had followed a coordinated voting pattern on the draft resolutions just adopted, the European Union as a whole had not adopted a legal definition of the term “forced displacement”, which was used in some of the draft resolutions. Furthermore, the use of the term “Palestine” could not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and was without prejudice to the individual positions of member States on the issue and, therefore, to the question of the validity of Palestine's accession to the international instruments referred to in the draft resolutions.
36. Some of the draft resolutions just adopted also referred to the ongoing tensions regarding the holy places in Jerusalem. The European Union was concerned about the worrying developments and recurrent violent clashes at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount. Fully acknowledging the special role of Jordan as custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, the European Union welcomed the understandings that had been reached between Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority in October 2015 and called for
8/9
15-20146
A/C.4/70/SR.25
the full implementation of the previous understandings reached in October 2014.
37. Ms. Abdelhady-Nasser (Observer for the State of Palestine) said that the Committee's adoption of the draft resolutions submitted under agenda items 54 and 55 resoundingly reaffirmed the rights of the Palestinian people, including Palestine refugees; the imperative of respect for humanitarian and human rights law; and the fundamental legal principles relevant to the core issues and the search for a just, comprehensive, lasting and peaceful solution, which, regrettably, remained elusive in the light of Israel's ongoing violations and intransigence. The action just taken by the Committee exemplified the role that the United Nations could and must play in safeguarding human rights and upholding international law.
38. Her delegation was grateful for the principled support of Member States, host countries and the donor community to UNRWA, particularly in the light of the unprecedented financial crisis it had faced. The Agency's humanitarian work and emergency assistance were vital for the survival of Palestine refugees and helped to promote regional stability.
39. Her delegation also appreciated the support expressed for the mandate of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories and for its efforts to raise international awareness of the systematic human rights violations perpetrated under the 48 -year Israeli military occupation. It stressed the importance of reaffirming the international consensus on the Fourth Geneva Convention's applicability to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and on the illegality of the Israeli settlement campaign and other grave breaches that were sabotaging what little opportunity remained for achieving peace under the two-State solution.
40. Mr. Ja'afari (Syrian Arab Republic) said that the overwhelming support for the draft resolutions just adopted under agenda items 54 and 55 sent an unambiguous message to Israel to end its occupation of all the occupied Arab territories and to cease immediately all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. As illustrated by the vote on the draft resolution on the occupied Syrian Golan (A/C.4/70/L.23), Israel's attempt to annex the Syrian Golan was null and void and without
international legal effect. The Syrian Arab Republic reserved the right to fully reclaim the territory by all legal means under the Charter of the United Nations and international law. In further aggravation of its brazen crime of annexation, Israel was bringing settlers to the occupied Syrian Golan in droves by offering them generous financial incentives, in addition to exploiting natural resources and arresting large numbers of Syrian citizens in the territory, including the Syrian Mandela, Sidqi al-Maqt, who had already spent over 27 years in Israeli jails.
41. Israel was the only State to have voted against the draft resolution on the occupied Syrian Golan and had voted against the entire set of draft resolutions under agenda items 54 and 55, demonstrating its blatant disregard for international consensus, the United Nations and international law. Such political isolation of Israel served as punishment for its continued occupation of the Syrian Golan. The Syrian delegation appealed to those few delegations that had abstained from voting on the draft resolution on the occupied Syrian Golan to join the international consensus and vote in favour when it came before the plenary Assembly. Any hesitation to condemn occupation and forced annexation would send a dangerous signal to lawbreakers such as Israel, suggesting that they could do as they pleased and that the law of the jungle had replaced the law.
