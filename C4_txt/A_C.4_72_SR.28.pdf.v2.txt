The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.
Agenda item 53: United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East
(continued) (A/C.4/72/L. 17, A/C.4/72/L.18,
A/C.4/72/L. 19 and A/C.4/72/L.20)
Agenda item 54: Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories (continued) (A/C.4/72/L.21, A/C.4/72/L.22, A/C.4/72/L.23, A/C.4/72/L.24 and A/C.4/72/L.25)
1. Mr. Habib (Indonesia), introducing the four draft resolutions submitted under agenda item 53 (A/C.4/72/L. 17, A/C.4/72/L.18, A/C.4/72/L.19 and A/C.4/72/L.20), said that they were based on those adopted the previous year, with updates reflecting the latest developments in the operations of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), including severe and recurrent shortages in funding. As highlighted in the report of the Secretary-General on the operations of UNRWA (A/71/849), the Agency was recognized as an important partner to the international community, even in a context of instability and socioeconomic deterioration in the region. Accordingly, predictable and sustainable funding was required to ensure the continuity of its services and, in his report, the Secretary-General called on States to maintain and increase their voluntary contributions, with multi-year funding and less earmarking. Those recommendations were reflected in the draft resolutions before the Committee and delegations were urged to support their implementation at a critical time for the Agency.
2. Mr. Rosario Rivera (Cuba), introducing the five
draft resolutions submitted under agenda item 54 (A/C.4/72/L.21, A/C.4/72/L.22, A/C.4/72/L.23,
A/C.4/72/L.24 and A/C.4/72/L.25), said that they were based on the resolutions adopted the previous year, with updates reflecting developments on the ground. They focused on the incessant violations of human rights and international law committed by Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the occupied Syrian Golan, which had been documented by the relevant United Nations bodies and human rights organizations on the basis of interviews with victims, witnesses and civil society. Unfortunately, Israel had persisted in its illegal actions, including forced displacement and arbitrary detention, in addition to provocations and incitement, particularly in occupied East Jerusalem. The occupying Power also continued to implement its illegal settlement campaign, which included land confiscation, appropriation of natural
resources, demolition of houses and the imposition of roadblocks, thereby fragmenting the Palestinian territory and severely undermining the possibility of achieving the two-State solution. It was hoped that Member States would once again support those crucial draft resolutions and work to apply the principles of international law in order to reach a just, lasting and peaceful solution to the conflict, while ensuring that the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence were realized.
3. Mr. Kendrick (United States of America) said that his delegation continued to oppose the annual submission of unfair draft resolutions biased against Israel. Such a one-sided approach was unacceptable since it damaged the prospects for peace by undermining trust between the parties and creating an unhelpful international environment.
4. Member States continued to single out Israel with such draft resolutions, which condemned settlement activity but not violence. Israel was blamed for the situation in Gaza, while the only mention of Hamas took the form of praise for its political agreement with Fatah. The United States would, therefore, vote against such one-sided draft resolutions and encouraged other delegations to do so as well.
5. His delegation was especially concerned by draft resolutions proposing to renew the mandates of counterproductive, biased and unnecessary special committees, such as the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, supported by the Division for Palestinian Rights, and the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories. Those bodies wasted limited United Nations resources, costing approximately $6.1 million in 2015, whilst they failed to contribute to peace in the region and instead perpetuated a United Nations bias against Israel.
6. The United States supported the good work of UNRWA with Palestinian refugees and had long been the Agency's largest donor, having contributed more than $350 million in 2017, but it did not support attempts to fund the Agency from the United Nations regular budget. Instead, it actively supported the efforts of UNRWA to seek new funding mechanisms with international and regional financial institutions. The United States called for equal burden-sharing among those States that supported the work of UNRWA, recalling that some of the Member States that had expressed concern about the Agency's funding shortfall contributed only minimally to its budget. States were

A/C.4/72/SR.28
urged to match their rhetoric with action by providing voluntary donations.
7. Whilst it continued to vigorously oppose any effort to delegitimize Israel or undermine its security at the United Nations, the United States remained actively engaged in the negotiation of a comprehensive peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians in order to introduce a positive new dynamic in the region.
8. Ms. Meitzad (Israel) speaking in explanation of vote before the voting, said that it was unfortunate that the Committee had, yet again, devoted over a week to discussions that contributed nothing to peace in the Middle East. The Committee was demonizing Israel rather than addressing the tragedy in Syria, the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, the continued sponsorship of terror by Iran, or the instability in Lebanon.
9. During the debates of the previous week, a representative of a regime guilty of heinous war crimes against its people, including the use of chemical weapons, had raised accusations against Israel, while other Member States that had seen the slaughter of thousands of civilians in brutal civil war, or that systematically oppressed and abused their people, had accused Israel of genocide and human rights violations. Israel would not stay silent in the face of such hypocritical absurdities. The one-sided draft resolutions being considered that day contributed little to resolving the complex situation in the Middle East and merely paid lip service to the Committee's mission. Those politicized texts did not reflect the facts, they promoted a distorted picture of reality on the ground, absolved the Palestinians of any responsibility and failed to mention positive developments achieved over the previous year. There had been substantial improvements in water, telecommunications, the reconstruction of Gaza and economic cooperation in the West Bank, mainly benefiting Palestinians. Yet, because of the Committee's institutionalized detest for Israel, such positive developments had been overlooked.
10. The draft resolution on the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices (A/C.4/72/L.21) exemplified the waste of United Nations resources as that entity only hindered constructive dialogue and understanding between Israelis and Palestinians. Although the Temple Mount - known as Har Habayit in Hebrew - was the holiest site in the Jewish faith and a place sacred to all three Abrahamic religions, the two draft resolutions mentioning the site made no reference to its Jewish or Christian connections. That deliberate omission attested to the persistent refusal of the Palestinians and their supporters to recognize the Jewish people's historical connection to that holy site and to the
city of Jerusalem. Nevertheless, historical truth would ultimately prevail over any political vote.
11. Technical explanations regarding agreed language could not excuse a vote in favour of a draft resolution that intentionally distorted history and disregarded Christian and Jewish heritage. The State of Israel would preserve the status quo on the Temple Mount, where the rights of all faiths were recognized.
12. Since the United Nations had voted 70 years earlier to partition the British mandate into two States for two peoples, a plan that that Jewish community had accepted, the Arab world had become entrenched in a belligerent attitude towards Israel rather than accepting the United Nations resolution and living in coexistence. The Palestinian people continued to reject all efforts toward peace, even at the expense of their own interests, and would rather demonize Israel in the Committee than work constructively to solve common problems.
13. Israel had reaffirmed its support for the two-State solution on countless occasions at home and abroad. It wondered when the Palestinians would recognize the right of Israel to exist as the homeland for the Jewish nation and when they would decide to work together to change the reality on the ground, rather than focusing on delivering empty statements in New York.
14. Her delegation would vote against the draft resolutions, which were nothing more than a cynical political exercise conducted at the expense of efforts to address the real issues that stood between Israelis and Palestinians on their joint path to create a better reality for both peoples. A vote against the draft resolutions constituted a vote for tolerance and mutual respect.
15. The Chair said that the representative of Israel had requested recorded votes on the draft resolutions submitted under agenda items 53 and 54, which had no programme budget implications.

42. Draft resolution A/C.4/72/L.25 was adopted by 154 votes to 2, with 17 abstentions.
43. Ms. Paju (Estonia), speaking on behalf of the European Union, said that while the European Union member States had followed a coordinated voting pattern on the draft resolutions just adopted under agenda item 54, the European Union as a whole had not adopted a legal definition of the term “forced displacement”, which was used in some of the draft resolutions. Furthermore, the use of the term “Palestine” could not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and was without prejudice to the individual positions of member States on the issue and, therefore, to the question of the validity of the accession of Palestine to the international instruments referred to in the draft resolutions.
44. With respect to the holy sites in Jerusalem, the European Union was concerned at the troubling developments and recurrent violent clashes at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount. Recalling the special significance of the holy sites, the European Union called
for the status quo of the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount established in 1967 to be upheld, in line with previous understandings and acknowledging the special role of Jordan. The position of the European Union with respect to the draft resolutions did not imply a change in its stance on the terminology concerning the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount. It was important for language used in reference to the holy sites to reflect their importance and historical significance for the three monotheistic religions and to take account of the necessary religious and cultural sensitivities; the future choice of language used in draft resolutions might affect the collective support of the European Union for the draft resolutions according to the established voting pattern.
45. Mr. Ja'afari (Syrian Arab Republic) said that the overwhelming support for the draft resolutions just adopted under agenda items 53 and 54 sent an unambiguous message to Israel to end its occupation of all the occupied Arab territories and to cease immediately all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. The fact that only two delegations had voted against the draft resolution on the occupied Syrian Golan (A/C.4/72/L.25) reaffirmed that the attempt by Israel to annex the Syrian Golan was null and void and without international legal effect, in accordance with Security Council resolution 497 (1981). The actions of Israel, including its ongoing settlement activity and cooperation with armed terrorist groups such as the Nusrah Front and Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, were a deliberate rebuke to all those who strived to uphold the principles of international law.
46. The representative of Israel had made many errors which invalidated her statement. Firstly, the so-called Balfour Declaration, which Israel used to justify its crimes in Palestine, was not a valid document because it had been issued by a representative of the British occupying Power, who had not had any right to give away Palestinian territory. Secondly, the very concept of a Jewish State was inherently flawed; given that the United Nations functioned on the basis of national, not religious, borders, it made no more sense to establish a Jewish State than it would to establish individual States bringing together all the Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Shinto, Confucian or pagan people in the world, respectively. Thirdly, the medical assistance that Israel boasted of providing to persons from the occupied Syrian Golan on so-called humanitarian grounds was in fact provided for the benefit of members of terrorist groups, including those responsible for the abduction of members of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the occupied Syrian Golan; Israel was thus acting in violation of international

resolutions that banned State support for terrorist organizations. In addition, the Syrian activist Sidqi al-Maqt, who had only been released in 2012 after spending 27 years in Israeli prisons, had been rearrested by Israel and sentenced to a further 25 years in prison, purely for having released video footage exposing Israeli cooperation with terrorists.
47. The world would not forget the massacres and destruction perpetrated by Israel in the towns of Deir Yassin, Qibya and Qana and in the Syrian Golan in 1967. Zionism was the real weapon of mass destruction in the Middle East; it was an extremist doctrine which spread violence and terrorism throughout the region. Despite the brazen Israeli claims to the contrary, the overwhelming international support for the nine resolutions just adopted in condemnation of Israel demonstrated the validity of those resolutions and the high value of the work of the Special Committee.
48. Ms. Abdelhady-Nasser (Observer for the State of Palestine) said that the adoption of the draft resolutions submitted under agenda items 53 and 54 by an overwhelming majority constituted a genuine expression of multilateralism and demonstrated the longevity of the international community's principled position on critical issues in the face of protracted injustice and conflict. Their adoption also attested to the durability of international law as it applied to the question of Palestine despite the ongoing attempts to undermine and nullify the law in that regard. Continued principled support for the rights of Palestine refugees, including the right of return, was vital and would confirm that those rights had not been diminished by the passage of time.
49. The draft resolutions, far from cynical or onesided, were firmly rooted in respect for international law; if anything, they barely captured the grim reality endured by civilians living under occupation and deprived of their rights for decades. Concerned negotiators had always ensured that the draft resolutions contained clear condemnations of any acts of violence, terror or provocation, regardless of the identity of the perpetrator. Any claim to the contrary was simply untrue. The draft resolutions reaffirmed the rights of the Palestinian people and the collective effort to uphold international law and contribute to a just, lasting and peaceful solution of the conflict.
50. Measures to ensure compliance with the resolutions would be essential to alleviating the Palestinian people's miserable plight. The continued absence of a political solution would usher in yet another year of deteriorating human rights conditions, suffering and growing instability in the Occupied
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, as a result of the half-century of Israeli occupation and its incessant violations.
51. She thanked all sponsors for their strong and principled support and welcomed the many new sponsors of the draft resolution on UNRWA operations. It was to be hoped that their support would be reinforced by funding in order to avoid any interruptions in the vital functioning of the Agency, which gave Palestine refugees hope and opportunity in fragile times and helped to stabilize the region. She underscored the significance of the unequivocal rejection of Israeli settlement activity and the call for its immediate and complete cessation, as well as the call for the illegal blockade of the Gaza Strip to be lifted immediately.
52. Mr. Maleki (Islamic Republic of Iran), speaking in exercise of the right of reply, said that the illegal, terrorist Israeli regime should abandon its futile attempt to defend its inhuman acts against Palestinians and, instead of talking nonsense about other countries, should repent of its many sins - occupation, land usurpation, killing innocent Palestinians, State terrorism and so forth. The killing of 63 Palestinians, including 20 children, over the previous year was a mark of shame on an Israeli regime proud of committing such crimes.
