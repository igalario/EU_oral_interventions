The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.
Organization of work (A/C.4/68/1; A/C.4/68/L.1; A/C.4/68/INF/1)
1. The Chair drew attention to document A/C.4/68/1, which contained the agenda items allocated to the Committee, and to document A/C.4/68/L.1, which contained the Committee's programme of work with a proposed timetable.
2. He then drew attention to the relevant rules and recommendations of the General Assembly contained in the report of the General Committee (A/68/250) regarding the work of the Main Committees, including those contained in General Assembly decision 34/401 and resolutions 58/126 and 58/316.
3. In order to make full use of the time and conference services that had been made available to the Committee, he would convene and adjourn meetings promptly and would convene meetings only when there were sufficient delegations inscribed on the list of speakers. All speakers, in particular the first three for a given meeting, should be present in the Committee room on time. The Assembly itself had decided to continue its practice of departing from the rule that one quarter of the members must be present for a Main Committee meeting to be declared open.
4. On questions of procedure and organization of work, the Committee would comply strictly with the relevant provisions of General Assembly decision 34/401. In line with the time limits for explanations of vote and rights of reply, statements on points of order should be limited to five minutes. He suggested that statements during the general debate should not exceed 10 minutes, or 15 minutes in the case of those speaking on behalf of groups of States.
5. The Secretariat required at least 48 hours to process draft resolutions, draft decisions and amendments in all languages. With regard to the programme budget implications of proposals and rule 153 of the rules of procedure, the General Assembly had drawn the Committee's attention to paragraph 12 of its decision 34/401, which made it imperative for the Main Committees to allow sufficient time for the preparation of the estimate of expenditures by the Secretariat and for its consideration by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth Committee. The General Committee had in turn drawn the General Assembly's attention to the
fact that the Secretary-General usually needed more than the 48 hours mandated in paragraph 13 (d) of decision 34/401 to review programme budget implications.
6. With reference to the Committee's agenda, item 122, entitled “Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly”, had been allocated to the Committee, under resolution 58/316, for the purpose of adopting its provisional programme of work for the next session and, under resolution 67/297, for the purpose of considering ways of streamlining its agenda. Additionally, again pursuant to resolution 67/297, the Committee would elect its officers under agenda item 5 approximately three months before the next session. Agenda item 135, entitled “Programme planning”, had been allocated to all the Main Committees and to the plenary Assembly, in order to enhance discussion of evaluation, planning, budgeting and monitoring reports.
7. The Committee would continue the practice of holding interactive dialogues under the agenda items relating to information, outer space, peacekeeping and the effects of atomic radiation, as well as to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine.
8. He took it that the Committee wished to approve the programme of work and the timetable contained in document A/C.4/68/L.1.
9. It was so decided.
10. The Chair informed the Committee that PaperSmart services would be offered to complement existing conference services and that only limited quantities of previously issued reports would be available in the conference room.
11. Also, as at previous sessions, the Committee would set up a working group of the whole to prepare draft resolutions for submission under agenda item 50, entitled “International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space”. It was his understanding that the working group would be chaired by the delegation of Japan. He took it that the Committee wished to establish the group.
12. It was so decided.
13. The Chair noted that, in approving its programme of work and timetable, the Committee had decided to hold one general debate covering all agenda items relating to decolonization, namely items 56 to 60,

enabling members to speak on any or all of those agenda items at any meeting devoted to the topic.
Requests for hearings
14. The Chair informed the Committee that he had received 87 communications containing requests for hearings relating to the questions of French Polynesia, Gibraltar, Guam, New Caledonia and Western Sahara, and suggested that they should be circulated as Committee documents for consideration at a subsequent meeting.
15. It was so decided.
16. The Chair said that he had also received a communication from the Chief Minister of Gibraltar, who wished to make a statement under agenda item 60. His statement would be scheduled accordingly.
The meeting rose at 10.35 a.m.
