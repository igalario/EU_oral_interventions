Agenda item 171: Financing of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (A/67/863 and 877)
1. Mr. Curry (Director, Peacekeeping Financing Division), introducing the note by the SecretaryGeneral on financing arrangements for the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2013 (A/67/863), said that in the light of the time required to prepare the Mission's results-based budget frameworks, determine the resource requirements for the 2013/14 financial period and conduct their legislative review, the budget for MINUSMA for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 would be submitted to the General Assembly at the main part of its sixty-eighth session. In the interim, the Secretary-General was seeking authority to enter into commitments, with assessment, to meet the initial start-up requirements of the Mission, in order to facilitate its rapid establishment and deployment.
2. Mr. Ruiz Massieu (Chair of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions), introducing the related report of the Advisory Committee (A/67/877), said that the Advisory Committee recommended that the Assembly should authorize the Secretary-General to enter into commitments for the period from 25 April to 31 December 2013 in the amount of $454,426,300, with a 10 per cent reduction in the assessment of the commitment authority for that period. The reduction was recommended because the Advisory Committee considered that the request for 23 backstopping positions at Headquarters should be reflected in an addendum to the support account proposal rather than in a request for commitment authority. Moreover, given that the Secretary-General had recently justified maintaining the existing backstopping capacity within the support account in order to address the needs of additional post-conflict environments that might arise, and considering that the closure of the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) would result in additional capacity at Headquarters, the Committee questioned whether the 23 positions were necessary.
3. The recommendation to reduce the assessment also reflected the fact that the Advisory Committee considered the current construction proposal for the
period to be unrealistic, given the large number of construction projects to be implemented by 31 December 2013, and took into account the low expenditure pattern of the commitment authority in the amount of $83,690,200 previously authorized by the Advisory Committee.
4. The recommendation on commitment authority was without prejudice to any position the Advisory Committee might take on the proposed structure, number and level of posts or on other proposed resources for MINUSMA in the context of budget submissions.
The meeting rose at 10.20 a.m.
