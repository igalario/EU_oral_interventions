14. The Chair recalled that the Committee had considered the draft resolution at its 33rd meeting, held on 24 May 2013.
15. Ms. Van Buerle (Secretary of the Committee) said that, in paragraph 15, the amount “492,622,000” should be inserted in the third line.
16. Mr. Yanouka (Israel) said that his Government's political and financial contributions to United Nations peacekeeping demonstrating its continued commitment to such operations. Israel was proud of its good relations and longstanding cooperation with peacekeeping forces in its region. Nonetheless, his delegation was disappointed, once again, that the draft resolution before the Committee contained politicized language that was unhelpful in supporting peacekeeping operations. Such language had no place in the draft resolution and marred the professional nature, good relations and consensusbuilding that usually prevailed in the Fifth Committee. The fourth preambular paragraph and paragraphs 4, 5 and 13 were intended to institutionalize an anti-Israel narrative at the United Nations. Rather than responding to the charges levelled in those paragraphs, his delegation would reserve its political comments for the relevant United Nations forums. It was regrettable that certain Member States had decided to draw the Committee into an unrelated political conflict by proposing language unrelated to the budget of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). He was therefore requesting a vote on the draft resolution and would vote against it. He called on other delegations to express their disapproval of the unconstructive language by doing the same.
17. The Chair said that a recorded vote had also been requested on the fourth preambular paragraph and paragraphs 4, 5 and 13 of the draft resolution.
18. A recorded vote was taken on the fourth preambular paragraph and paragraphs 4, 5 and 13 of the draft resolution.

19. The fourth preambular paragraph and paragraphs 4, 5 and 13 of draft resolution A/C.5/67/L.37 were adopted by 83 votes to 3, with 41 abstentions.
20. Mr. Mohamad (Lebanon), speaking in explanation of position, said that the wording of the proposed paragraphs was not political in nature, since they merely called on Israel to comply with previous General Assembly resolutions requesting it to pay reparations to the Organization in the amount of $1,117,005 for the shelling of the United Nations compound at Qana in 1996, which had destroyed the UNIFIL headquarters, killing 108 Lebanese civilians and injuring scores of others who had sought refuge in the compound. The reparations were entirely earmarked to compensate the United Nations for damage to property; none would go to the Lebanese State or the victims' families. As the matter was purely financial in

nature and concerned the financing of peacekeeping operations, it was naturally within the purview of the Fifth Committee.
21. A recorded vote was taken on the draft resolution as a whole, as orally amended.
In favour:
Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Chile, China, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Lithuania, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of Tanzania, Uruguay, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe.

Abstaining:

22. Draft resolution A/C.5/67/L.37 as a whole, as orally amended, was adopted by 124 votes to 3.
23. Ms. Mannion (Ireland), speaking on behalf of the European Union; the acceding country Croatia; the candidate countries Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the
stabilization and association process countries Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina; and, in addition, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, said that the States members of the European Union were concerned at the lack of consensus on the draft resolution and the politicization of the Committee's work. The delegations had abstained during the voting on the fourth preambular paragraph and paragraphs 4, 5 and 13 of the draft resolution in the conviction that the text as drafted was inappropriate in a draft resolution pertaining to the financing of UNIFIL. In April 1996, the General Assembly had discussed the broader political aspects of the events concerned, including the incident at Qana, and adopted resolution 50/22 C. The States members of the European Union had stated their opinion on those political aspects at that time. While they wished that the Committee's deliberations had been confined to the budgetary aspects of the financing of UNIFIL, they had nevertheless voted in favour of the draft resolution as a whole, in order to provide the necessary financing for UNIFIL to fulfil its mandate.
24. Ms. Norman (United States of America) said that, while her Government strongly supported UNIFIL, the use of funding resolutions of the General Assembly to pursue claims against a Member State was not procedurally correct. Her delegation had therefore also voted against the resolutions in previous years which called on Israel to pay costs stemming from the incident at Qana; those resolutions had not been adopted by consensus. The procedure followed almost since the founding of the United Nations was for the Secretary-General to present and pursue the settlement of the Organization's claims against a State or States. Using a funding resolution to legislate a settlement was inappropriate and should be avoided, as it politicized the work of the Fifth Committee.

33. Mr. Garcia Landa (Mexico) said that his delegation had joined the consensus on the draft resolution in a constructive spirit focused on the welfare of United Nations staff and the smooth implementation of their missions. Nevertheless, it was clear from the budget estimates for the new Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sahel that special political missions received the type of support from Headquarters and financing that should be given only to traditional peacekeeping operations. The administrative and budgetary rules for special political missions were fundamentally inadequate and that had an adverse effect on the programming of essential activities and on mission governance, accountability and oversight. It should be a priority for Member States to correct those anomalies in order to ensure continuity, certainty, predictability and transparency, as well as the proper management of the Organization.
