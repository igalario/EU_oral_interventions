A/C.5/68/SR.46
The meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.
Agenda item 134: Programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015 (continued)
Programme budget implications of draft resolution A/68/L.49: Modalities for the third International Conference on Financing for Development (A/68/7/Add.29 and A/C.5/68/24)
1. Mr. Huisman (Director, Programme Planning and Budget Division), introducing the statement of programme budget implications of draft resolution A/68/L.49 (A/C.5/68/24), said that the adoption of the draft resolution by the General Assembly would give rise to additional requirements in the amount of $1,808,700 under the programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015, including $1,727,500 under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference services; $18,200 under section 12, Trade and development; and $63,000 under section 28, Public information. Those sums would represent a charge against the contingency fund and, as such, would require the General Assembly to approve an additional appropriation for the biennium 20142015.
2. The Chair drew attention the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/68/7/Add.29) and the statement of the Chair of the Advisory Committee, which had been circulated to Committee members.
3. Ms. Rios (Plurinational State of Bolivia), speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, said that the Group attached great importance to the third International Conference on Financing for Development and underscored the important role that it would play in strengthening international cooperation for development. The Group therefore fully supported the appropriation of the resources requested.

5. The Chair said that he took note of the comments of the representative of China and urged all delegations to work as hard as possible in order to arrive at a consensus on all outstanding issues as quickly as possible.
The meeting rose at 3.15 p.m.
