The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.
Agenda item 176: Financing of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (A/68/782/Add.18 and A/68/874)
1. The Chair paid tribute to all the women and men who had served and continued to serve in United Nations peacekeeping operations, particularly those who had made the ultimate sacrifice. The best way to pay homage to them and to observe the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers would be for the Committee to work tirelessly to ensure that they had the necessary resources to fulfil their mandates.
2. Ms. Casar (Controller), introducing the note by the Secretary-General on the financing arrangements for the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) for the period from 10 April to 31 December 2014 and for the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015 (A/68/874), said that in view of the time required for the preparation of the Mission's full resource requirements for 2014/15 and for the legislative review, the budget for MINUSCA for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015 would be submitted to the General Assembly at the main part of its sixty-ninth session. In the interim, the SecretaryGeneral was requesting a commitment authority with assessment in the amount of $313 million for the period from 10 April to 31 December 2014 to meet the most immediate and essential start-up requirements for the establishment and deployment of the Mission. That amount included the $59.6 million previously authorized by the Advisory Committee for the period from 10 April to 30 June 2014.
3. In addition, it was proposed to establish 28 temporary positions for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015, to be funded under the support account for peacekeeping operations, in order to provide critical support and oversight for the Mission in its initial phase. The associated financial resource requirements were estimated at $6.1 million for that 12-month period.
4. Mr. Ruiz Massieu (Chair of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions), introducing the related report of the Advisory Committee (A/68/782/Add.18), said that the Advisory Committee recommended approval of the proposed commitment authority in the amount of
$312,976,400 for the period from 10 April to 31 December 2014, inclusive of the amount of $59,552,000 previously authorized by the Advisory Committee for the period from 10 April to 30 June 2014. It also recommended approval of the proposed requirements under the support account for peacekeeping in the amount of $4,993,700 from the $6,114,400 requested for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015.
5. With regard to the Secretary-General's proposal for 28 temporary positions to be funded under the support account, the Advisory Committee recommended against the approval of the positions of Geographic Information Systems Officer (P-3), Procurement Officer (P-3), Investigator (P-3) and Team Assistant (General Service (Other level)), since capacity for those functions already existed. The Advisory Committee further recommended that the positions and related operational costs of the Electoral Officer (P-4) and Administrative Assistant (General Service (Other level)) for the Electoral Assistance Division should be financed from within the proposed amount of the commitment authority for MINUSCA.
6. Mr. Dosseh (Togo), speaking on behalf of the Group of African States, expressed concern at the late submission of the documentation for the item, and urged the Secretary-General to continue to address the underlying factors contributing to the late issuance of documents.
7. The Group shared the concerns about the deterioration of the security situation in the Central African Republic and reaffirmed its determination to spare no effort to re-establish peace and security in the country and the wider region. The Group had taken note of the close coordination with the African Union and the deployment of a transition team to set up MINUSCA and prepare the transition of authority from the African-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic (MIScA) to MINUSCA by 15 September 2014. His delegation attached great importance to cooperation between the African Union and the United Nations, particularly with regard to peacekeeping operations. The Group would examine the budget proposal closely with a view to reaching a positive outcome before the end of the second part of the resumed session.
The meeting rose at 3.20p.m.
