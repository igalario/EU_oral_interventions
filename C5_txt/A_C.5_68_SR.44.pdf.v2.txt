A/C.5/68/SR.44
The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
Agenda item 159: Financing of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Middle East (continued)
(b) United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(continued) (A/C.5/68/L.39)
Draft resolution A/C.5/68/L.39: Financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
1. Mr. Ballantyne (New Zealand), speaking as the coordinator of the informal consultations on sub-item 159 (b), said that the Committee had been unable to reach consensus on the text of the draft resolution.
2. Ms. Rios Requena (Plurinational State of Bolivia), introducing the draft resolution on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, said that the SecretaryGeneral had reported, in the budget for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for 2014/15 (A/68/757), that Israel had not paid the amount of $1,117,005 due as accounts receivable for UNIFIL as a result of the incident at Qana on 18 April 1996. Moreover, no response had been received to the Secretary-General's letters on the matter to Israel. The Group was therefore submitting a draft resolution in which the Assembly reiterated its previous requests for payment and requested the Secretary-General to report to it at its sixty-ninth session.
3. The Chair said that action would be taken on the draft resolution at a subsequent meeting. He drew the Committee's attention to a letter dated 29 May 2014 from the Chair of the Group of 77 and China concerning the late submission of documents, to be circulated after the meeting. The Bureau had been seized of the matter and was examining possible solutions with the Advisory Committee, the Secretariat and the incoming Bureau of the Committee. The Committee would be given an update in due course.
The meeting rose at 10.15 a.m.
