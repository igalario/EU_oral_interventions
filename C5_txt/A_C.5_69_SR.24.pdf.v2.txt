The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
Agenda item 132: Programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015 (continued)
Revised estimates resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fifty, twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh sessions and its twenty-first and twenty-second special sessions (A/69/615 and A/69/670)
Programme budget implications of draft resolution A/69/L.42: Investigation into the conditions and circumstances resulting in the tragic death of Dag Hammarskjold and of the members of the party accompanying him (A/69/669; A/C.5/69/14)
1. Mr. Huisman (Director, Programme Planning and Budget Division), introducing the SecretaryGeneral's report on the revised estimates resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh sessions and its twenty-first and twenty-second special sessions (A/69/615), recalled that the General Assembly, in its resolutions 63/263 and 65/281, had decided that all financial implications emanating from the resolutions and decisions of the Human Rights Council during the year, including at its September session, should be presented to the Committee annually. The present report detailed total budgetary requirements of $52,073,200 for the bienniums 2014-2015 and 2016-2017.
2. Of those requirements, the amount of $25,048,800 related to activities of a perennial nature and was therefore already included in the programme budget for 2014-2015. The amount of $10,097,400 related to commitment authorities approved by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in 2014 under General Assembly resolution 68/249 and the related appropriations were being sought in the context of the first performance report on the programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015. Of the balance of the requirements, it was proposed that $158,300 should be accommodated within the existing appropriations and that $12,301,900 should be appropriated, representing a charge against the contingency fund for the current biennium.
3. It was also proposed that from 1 January 2015 one P-5 post, one P-4 post and seven P-3 posts should be established under section 24, Human rights, of the
programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015 and that the activities mandated by the Council in its resolutions 25/25, 26/20, 26/22, 27/1 and 27/21 should be supported.
4. The net additional requirements of $4,466,800 for the biennium 2016-2017 would be considered in the context of the proposed programme budget for that biennium.
5. Introducing the statement submitted by the Secretary-General in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly on the programme budget implications of draft resolution A/69/L.42 on the investigation into the conditions and circumstances resulting in the tragic death of Dag Hammarskjold and of the members of the party accompanying him (A/C.5/69/14), he said that, under the draft resolution, the Assembly would request the Secretary-General to appoint an independent panel of experts to examine new information, assess its probative value and report on progress to the Assembly at its seventieth session. Should the Assembly adopt the draft resolution, additional resources in the amount of $451,000 would be required in 2015 to implement that request. As there was no provision in the programme budget for the implementation of those activities, it was proposed that that amount should be approved as a charge against the contingency fund.
6. Mr. Ruiz Massieu (Chair of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions), introducing the report of the Advisory Committee on the revised estimates resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council (A/69/670), said that the Advisory Committee considered that the Secretary-General's report should have a more reader-friendly structure and should be condensed, which would also reduce the costs related to its production in the six official languages.
7. With respect to the absorption of requirements from existing resources, the Advisory Committee believed that there was room to absorb a higher amount than the $153,800 proposed by the Secretary-General. By and large, the Secretary-General should accommodate additional requirements for mandated activities from within existing resources to the extent possible while also ensuring the effective implementation of mandates.
8. The Advisory Committee's comments and recommendations on specific resource reductions in

connection with commitments for Human Rights Council resolutions in 2014 appeared not to have been taken into consideration in the Secretary-General's proposal for revised estimates. The Advisory Committee maintained those recommendations and recommended that the proposed additional requirements for the biennium 2014-2015 should be reduced accordingly.
9. Subject to the observations and recommendations made in its report, the Advisory Committee recommended approval of the Secretary-General's proposals.
10. Turning to the Advisory Committee's report on the programme budget implications of draft resolution A/69/L.42 (A/69/669), he said that, while the Advisory Committee had no objection to the amount of $400,100 being requested under section 1 of the programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015, it had considered the status of expenditure under section 1 as at 30 November 2014 and recommended that the amount should be absorbed.
11. The Advisory Committee had no objection to the additional appropriation of $50,900 requested under section 2 of the programme budget. It intended to examine in greater detail the costing model for the processing of official documents at the four duty stations - New York, Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi - in the context of the proposed programme budget for 2016-2017.
12. Consequently, the Advisory Committee recommended that the Fifth Committee should inform the General Assembly that, should the Assembly adopt draft resolution A/69/L.42, an additional appropriation of $50,900 would be required, representing a charge against the contingency fund, under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference services, of the programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015.
13. Ms. Rios Requena (Plurinational State of Bolivia), speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, said that the Group had taken note that the adoption of draft resolution A/69/L.49 would result in additional requirements in the amount of $451,000 under the programme budget for the current biennium and supported the provision of those resources. Adequate resources should be provided under the regular budget to ensure the implementation of all
mandates approved by intergovernmental bodies of the United Nations.
14. Mr. Thoresson (Sweden) said that, as the second Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold had had a profound influence on the role of the United Nations during his lifetime and had demonstrated a vision and pragmatism that had paved the way for policies and practices that had become ingrained in the Organization. While much was known about his life and contributions, the incident that had abruptly and violently ended his life remained unclear. The purpose of draft resolution A/69/L.49 was to shed light on the circumstances surrounding that incident by bringing documents to light and by having relevant testimony heard so as to bring closure to the matter, out of respect for the memory and dignity of Dag Hammarskjold and those who had perished with him.
15. Ms. Muthukumarana (Sri Lanka), referring to the revised estimates resulting from resolutions of the Human Rights Council, said that her Government was opposed to the OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka established pursuant to Council resolution 25/1, as it challenged the sovereignty and independence of a Member State. The OHCHR Investigation violated the fundamental principle of international law according to which national remedies must be exhausted before resorting to international mechanisms. That principle had been disregarded by the Human Rights Council and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Her Government was continuing its own process of accountability, justice, reconciliation and nation-building, guided by the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. Resolution 25/1 focused on alleged events long past, setting a precedent that would be problematic for many members of the international community.
16. Her Government had made it clear that it would not cooperate with the investigation. Her delegation had concerns about the arbitrary manner in which the investigation had been carried out and the related expenditures. The extensive travel undertaken by the investigators raised concerns, particularly since they had visited only critics of Sri Lanka. In informal consultations, her delegation would seek an answer to the question of how the OHCHR investigation team could have spent all of its funds, given that one third of that funding had been intended for travel to Sri Lanka that had not actually taken place.

17. It was a matter of concern that, at a time when the Human Rights Council was complaining of budgetary constraints, the entire amount allocated for one mission had been spent. OHCHR was short of funds to carry out its regular mandate, yet it was being asked to expend scarce resources on a mission that was politically motivated, duplicated ongoing internal processes, focused on events that had occurred more than five years earlier and would fail to advance global human rights because it would generate opposition rather than cooperation.
18. Mr. Giorgio (Eritrea) said that his delegation applauded all those who made voluntary financial contributions to the Organization. However, the fact that a significant portion of budgetary resources came from voluntary contributions posed its own challenges, as it introduced unpredictability and uncertainty into the work of the human rights bodies, with potential effects on critical activities for the promotion and protection of human rights.
19. When the Human Rights Council was established, institution-building had been one of the most important mandates entrusted to it, yet the current level of funding for technical support and capacity-building was inadequate. The number of Council resolutions with mandates involving individual countries was growing every year; in addition to a proliferation of country mandates, more than one mechanism was sometimes mandated to address the same cases in the same countries. The Human Rights Council should rationalize its work so as to carry out its mandate effectively and avoid overlapping mandates and duplication of activities.
