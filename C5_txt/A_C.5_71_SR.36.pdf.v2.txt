The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.
Agenda item 115: Appointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other appointments
(continued)
(b) Appointment of members of the Committee on Contributions (continued) (A/71/102/Rev.1/Add.3)
1. The Chair drew the Committee's attention to a note by the Secretary-General (A/71/102/Rev.1/Add.3) informing the General Assembly of the resignation of Mr. Hough (United Kingdom) from the Committee on Contributions, effective 3 May 2017. The Government of the United Kingdom had nominated Mr. Townley, whose candidature had been endorsed by the Group of Western European and Other States, to fill the vacancy for the remaining period of the term of office, which would expire on 31 December 2017.
2. Mr. Townley (United Kingdom) was recommended by acclamation for appointment to the Committee on Contributions for a term of office beginning on the date of appointment by the General Assembly and expiring on 31 December 2017.
Agenda item 134: Programme budget for the biennium 2016-2017 (continued)
Programme budget implications of draft resolution A/71/L.66: Strengthening the capability of the United Nations system to assist Member States in implementing the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (A/C.5/71/22 and A/71/912)
3. Mr. Guazo (Acting Deputy Controller), introducing the statement of programme budget implications of draft resolution A/71/L.66 (A/C.5/71/22), said that, pursuant to the draft resolution, the Secretary-General would establish a new Office of Counter-Terrorism as a separate component under section 3, Political affairs, of the programme budget, to be headed by an UnderSecretary-General reporting directly to the Secretary General. Following approval by the General Assembly, the Secretary-General would, inter alia, appoint an Under-Secretary-General, supported by a special assistant at the P-3 level, to serve as head of the Office of Counter-Terrorism, Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and Executive Director of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre. The Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office and the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre, together with their programme budget and extrabudgetary resources, would be transferred from
the Department of Political Affairs to the Office of Counter-Terrorism.
4. The adoption of the draft resolution would give rise to additional requirements in the amount of $390,600 for the biennium 2016-2017, comprising $162,700 under section 3, Political affairs; $210,500 under section 29D, Office of Central Support Services; and $17,400 under section 36, Staff assessment. However, those requirements would be absorbed within the programme budget approved for the biennium. The General Assembly was requested to approve the establishment of one Under-SecretaryGeneral post and one P-3 post under section 3, Political affairs, of the programme budget for the biennium 2016-2017.
5. Mr. Sene (Vice-Chair of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions), introducing the related report of the Advisory Committee (A/71/912), said that the Advisory Committee recommended that the General Assembly should approve the proposed establishment of two posts at the Under-Secretary-General and P-3 levels.
6. The Advisory Committee had been informed that, subject to the adoption of draft resolution A/71/L.66 by the General Assembly, the related resource requirements for the biennium 2018-2019 would be presented to the legislative bodies for their consideration during their review of the proposed programme budget for 2018-2019. The Advisory Committee would review those resource requirements once they had been submitted by the SecretaryGeneral.
7. Ms. Pereira Sotomayor (Ecuador), speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, said that if the draft resolution was adopted, the Group would support the provision of the resources that had been requested by the Secretary-General and endorsed by the Advisory Committee. Sufficient resources should be provided under the regular budget to ensure the implementation of all mandates approved by the Organization's intergovernmental bodies.
8. Ms. Norman Chalet (United States of America) said that the Secretary-General's resource request responded to the clearly mandated tasks outlined in draft resolution A/71/L.66. That request and the recommendation of the Advisory Committee were fiscally prudent and enjoyed the support of her delegation.
9. Her delegation looked forward to reviewing the full budget proposal for the new Office of CounterTerrorism in the budget submission for 2018 -2019; that

proposal should include further efficiencies owing to the consolidation of the staff and functions of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office and the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre.
10. Mr. Podlesnykh (Russian Federation) said that his delegation noted with satisfaction the submission of the draft resolution and trusted that the Fifth Committee would speedily complete its consideration of the related financial implications. He welcomed the Secretary-General's proposal to implement the draft resolution using existing resources and thereby not to increase the financial burden on Member States during the current biennium. He also welcomed the Advisory Committee's recommendations regarding the financial and human resources for the Office of CounterTerrorism.
Agenda item 150: Financing of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (continued) (A/71/876 and A/71/913)
11. Ms. Costa (Director, Peacekeeping Financing Division), introducing the note by the Secretary General on the financing arrangements for the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) for the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017 (A/71/876), said that the General Assembly, by its resolution 70/269, had approved the appropriation and assessment of $268.6 million for the maintenance of UNISFA for the 2016/17 period. Since the adoption of that resolution, exceptional deferred costs from the 2015/16 period and substantial changes in the assumptions underpinning the budget for 2016/17 had resulted in additional resource requirements in the amount of $18.4 million.
12. During the 2016/17 period, UNISFA had sought to reprioritize the utilization of its approved resources to the extent possible, and the Force was expected to be able to absorb from within its approved budget an amount of $7.1 million. However, based on its operational requirements and expenditure projections, UNISFA would require additional resources in the amount of $11.3 million to meet the remaining costs of reimbursement of the troop-contributing country for standard troop costs and related allowances; contingent-owned major equipment; and selfsustainment reimbursement and rations costs in respect of the tank and artillery units for the 2016/17 period, for which no provision had been made in the approved budget.
13. The General Assembly was requested to appropriate and assess the amount of $11.3 million for the 12-month period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017.
That was in addition to the amount of $268.6 million already appropriated and assessed under General Assembly resolution 70/269.
14. Mr. Sene (Vice-Chair of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions), introducing the related report of the Advisory Committee (A/71/913), said that the Advisory Committee recommended that the General Assembly should authorize the Secretary-General to enter into commitments of $11.3 million, without assessment, for the maintenance of UNISFA during the 2016/17 period. It also recommended that, in his next budget performance report on UNISFA, the Secretary-General should provide detailed information on actual expenditures incurred in 2016/17.
15. Mr. Woldeyes (Ethiopia) said that, according to the report of the Secretary-General on the budget performance of UNISFA for the period from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016 (A/71/624), the security situation in the Abyei area remained peaceful but unpredictable, which was a clear testimony to the mission's effectiveness in fulfilling its mandate. Unfortunately, it was neither justified nor fair for the United Nations to expect UNISFA to achieve more under its mandate with fewer resources. The Group agreed with the Advisory Committee on the importance of settling claims by troop- and police-contributing countries in a timely manner and called on the Fifth Committee to endorse the prompt reimbursement of outstanding claims and the resources required to close financing gaps for the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017. The Committee should demonstrate unity of purpose during the current informal negotiations, as the Member States had a shared responsibility to reach agreement on justifiable and appropriate resource requirements for the functioning of the United Nations and its peacekeeping operations.
Agenda item 160: Financing of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Middle East (continued)
(b) United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (continued) (A/C.5/71/L.31)
Draft resolution A/C.5/71/L.31: Financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
16. Mr. Wickramarachchige (Sri Lanka), speaking as the coordinator of the informal consultations on sub-item 160 (b), said that the Committee had been unable to reach consensus on the text of the draft resolution.
17. Ms. Pereira Sotomayor (Ecuador) introducing the draft resolution on behalf of the Group of 77 and

China, said that the Secretary-General, in the proposed budget for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for the period from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018 (A/71/765 and A/71/765/Corr.1), stated that Israel had not paid the amount of $1,117,005 resulting from the tragic incident at Qana on 18 April 1996. The Secretary-General further explained that he had received no response to his subsequent letters addressed to the Permanent Mission of Israel in that regard, the latest dated 16 January 2017.
18. The Group stressed once again that Israel should pay the amount due in connection with the incident at Qana on 18 April 1996, and requested the SecretaryGeneral to report on the matter to the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. The Group also reiterated its acknowledgement of the sacrifices made by UNIFIL and its contribution to the restoration of peace and security in the region.
19. Mr. Wax (Israel) said that, during consideration of the agenda item on UNIFIL each year, the Group of 77 and China had established an unfortunate ritual of politicizing the work of the Fifth Committee by singling out Israel, the only Member State to be singled out in that manner. The Committee had an important role to play in United Nations peacekeeping missions and should pride itself in taking a professional, not a political, approach to its deliberations; the repetitive biased conduct against Israel undermined the integrity and professionalism of the Committee and its work. If Member States wished to accomplish the job at hand, they might do well to remember that repetition reinforced repetition, whereas change fostered more change.
20. The Chair said that action would be taken on the draft resolution at a subsequent meeting.
The meeting rose at 10.40 a.m.
